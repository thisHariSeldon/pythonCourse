# ------------------ CLASS 21 - Strings -----------

# A string is a series of characters in between quotation marks, does not matter what the character is. 
# May be between "" or ''. The advantage of using '' instead of "" is that we can place quotes in between quotes:
 
string = 'He used to say his name was "Yaures" but that was just an achronomy'
print(string)

# escape CHARACTERS (string literal): they are meant to give strings a particular behaviour (\" x \")
stringEscape = "He used to say his name was \"Yaures\"."
print(stringEscape)

# raw strings (r prefix)
print(r"This is a raw string: \n will not create a new line.")
# \n this is a new line
print("This is NOT a raw string: \n it creates a new line underneath.")
# \t is a TAB
print("This is a tab \tas you can see")
# \b backspace (deletes previous character)
print('Hari \bSeldon')
# \f female icon (?)
print('Hari \f Seldon')
# \r retorno de carro (moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line, used in situations where you want to overwrite a line in the terminal)
print('Hari \r Seldon')
# \v varon icon (male)
print('Hari \v Seldon')

# ------------------ CLASS 24 - String METHODS -----------

'''
A string method BUILT-IN function that you can call on a string to perform specific operations or manipulations. These methods are designed to make common tasks involving strings easier, such as formatting, searching, splitting, or transforming them.
Methods tied to objects use .method(), but there is many more methods like @classmethod, @staticmethod or special methods/dunder methods/magic methods 
like __init__() or __str__()

# CHARACTER METHODS (not their real name)

goal = ' be the motherfucking best one in this shit, and flex that MONEY'

# .lower() - every character to lowercase
print(goal.lower()) 
# .upper - every character to uppercase
print(goal.upper()) 
# .capitalize - first letter in uppercase
print(goal.capitalize())
# .title - each begging character is capitalized
print(goal.title())
# .swapcase - lowers to uppers and viceversa
print(goal.swapcase())
# .strip - removes any space that might be in the beggining or end of the string
print(goal.strip())
# .replace - replaces one word for another. The FIRST ARGUMENT must be the original string and the SECOND the replacement
print(goal.replace("motherfucking", "ultimate"))
# .count("o") - counts how many of that string there are
print(goal.count("o"))
